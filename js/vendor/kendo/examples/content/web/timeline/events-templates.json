    "description": "Barcelona is an excellent place to discover world-class arts and culture. Bullfighting was officially banned several years ago, but the city remains rich with festivals and events. The sights in Barcelona are second to none. Don’t miss the architectural wonder, Casa Mila—otherwise known as La Pedrera. It’s a modernist apartment building that looks like something out of an expressionist painting. Make your way up to the roof for more architectural surprises. And if you like Casa Mila, you’ll want to see another one of Antoni Gaudi’s architectural masterpieces, Casa Batllo, which is located at the center of Barcelona.\r\nTenerife, one of the nearby Canary Islands, is the perfect escape once you’ve had your fill of the city. In Los Gigantes, life revolves around the marina. Take a boat out in search of bottlenose dolphins and whales. For the able-bodied visitor, take a climb up “Cardiac Hill” to get a breathtaking view—and workout. While you’re in Tenerife, visit Mount Teide. It’s the highest point in Spain and the third-largest volcano in the world.\r\n",

To take things in a somewhat chronological order, best to begin your trip in the north, checking out Boston’s Freedom Trail, Fenway Park, the Statue of Liberty, and Niagara Falls. Bring your raincoat to Niagara Falls, which straddles the boarder between Canada and the United States—the majestic sight might have you feeling misty in every sense of the word. Bring your walking shoes to the Freedom Trail. The 2.5-mile walk will take you on an historical tour of sites relevant to the American Revolution. When you visit Fenway Park, you might be wise to bring a helmet. With fly balls that average a speed of 100 miles per hour, you can never be too safe. Bring a healthy set of lungs to the Statue of Liberty and remember to make an advanced reservation if you’d like to climb the stairs to Lady Liberty’s crown. Finish up your tour at the south end of the coast with Kennedy Space Center in Florida and be sure to bring the kids. Everyone will get the chance to touch an authentic moon rock and stand under the largest rocket ever flown.",

Visit the National Museum of Archaeology to see a spectacular range of artifacts dating back to Malta’s Neolithic period (5000 BC).

    "description": "The Big Apple is a living city, perhaps more so than any other city on Earth. When people come to New York, they fall in love. Not with some local person, restaurant, building, or bar—they fall in love with the city as a whole. It’s easy to see why when you step back and examine the endless variety of life NYC has to offer. It’s almost like a bag filled with hundreds of Broadway sets exploded and all the charming pieces of this city just fell right into place. A twilight stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge, an afternoon of kite flying (or picnicking) in Central Park, a Broadway show or just a couple hours of wandering through Greenwich Village and you’ll be well on your way to NYC infatuation. Don’t expect to see it all in one trip. That will only leave you feeling exhausted and unsuccessful. Chances are, you’ll want to return soon anyway. This tour packs another city you wouldn’t want to miss – Washington D.C. Prepare to be fully captivated by the Nation\u0027s Capitol seen at night and the breathtaking views of the national monuments and federal buildings flooded in lights. The US Capitol Building, the Kennedy Center, the Washington Monument and the Federal Triangle are just a tiny part of everything Washington has to offer.  ",

    "description": "Turkey and Greece—two countries filled with ancient history and breathtaking scenery—make the perfect combo for a luxurious vacation with soul. Istanbul is coated in a texture of beautiful details, giving visitors ornate and tasty souvenirs to take home after their visit. The Eminonu quarter of the Faith district is home to the Spice Bazaar, one of the largest bazaars in the city. Try before you buy and do as the locals do in order to get the most value out of your visit. There will be lots to choose from and you might have trouble differentiating between the high- and low-quality shops otherwise. Greece is, of course, filled with architectural marvels including the Erechtheum, an iconic temple in Athens. The Porch of the Maidens is as distinctive today as it was when it was completed in 406 BC. Ladies, bring a scarf to cover your hair if you visit a mosque. Or, better yet, buy one during your travels to remember your vacation by.",

    "description": "On your journey through the culturally rich countries of Central Europe, you’ll find a wide variety of sights and experiences. There is a world of history in Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, and lots to be learned along the way. Many attractions will provide a first-hand look at the sites where some of our world’s most defining moments have taken place—both joyous and tragic. Visit the remains of the Berlin Wall and learn more about the somewhat recent conflicts that tore Germany in two—and the reunification that followed. In Prague, take a lighter look at our recent history with a visit to the architecturally mesmerizing “Dancing House” designed by Croatian-Czech architect, Vlado Milunic and Canadian-American architect, Frank Gehry. Be sure to call ahead and find out if you need an appointment as some of the most historical landmarks can become busy and require reservations for full access to the building or site.",
